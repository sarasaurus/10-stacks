# Project Name Stacks
**Author**: Sarah B
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)
## Overview
- implement a Stack Class using,internally, a Linked List class
- implement push(value) and pop() methods on the Stack class
- implement peek() and isEmpty() methods on the Stack class

## Installing and Using the Data Structure
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
## Change Log
<!-- Use this are to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:
01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with GET and POST routes for the book resource.
## Credits and Collaborations
<!-- Give credit (and a link) to other people or resources that helped you build this application. -->

####  Documentation
  * in your README, write documentation for you data structures
  * your documentation should includes code block useage examples
  * provide instructions for:
    * installing and using your data structure
    * accessing each method
    * running your tests

#### Feature Tasks
  * implement a Stack Class  using,internally, a Linked List class
  * implement `push(value)` and `pop()` methods on the Stack class
	* implement `peek()` and `isEmpty()` methods on the Stack class

## Bonus Points:
  * 2pts
  * implement Reverse Polish Notation using your Stack data structure
    * refer to the [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) for more information on RPN

#### Rubric:
  * Tests: 2pts
  * Passes linter: 1pts
  * Completed Data Structure: 5pts
  * Big-O notation: 2pt
